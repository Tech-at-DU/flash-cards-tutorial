# Flash Cards Tutorial
This tutorial uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive set of flash cards. 

By completing this tutorial you will learn how HTML is structure for a document displayed in the browser, how CSS styles and determines the appearance of the document, and how JavaScript manages the busniness logic and handles user interactions. 

## Requirements
The only requirements for this tutorial are a web browser, and a code editor. I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) but you can use any code editor.
